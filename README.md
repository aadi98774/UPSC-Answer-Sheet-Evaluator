# 🧠 AI-Based UPSC Answer Sheet Evaluation with RAG

This project implements an end-to-end AI pipeline to evaluate scanned handwritten UPSC answer sheets using GPT-4o and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system grounded in an official SOP Evaluation PDF.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Install Dependencies

This project uses `pip` for dependency management:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

▶️ Run the Application

```
streamlit run evaluation.py
```

Once the app launches, upload a scanned PDF of a student's handwritten UPSC answer sheet to generate a structured evaluation report.

### 🔄 Evaluation Pipeline

1. OCR Extraction: Uses GPT-4o Vision to extract handwritten Hindi text from uploaded answer sheet.

2. Segmentation: Separates the answer into Introduction, Body, Conclusion.

3. Context Retrieval: Retrieves SOP chunks relevant to each section using a vector search on embedded SOP.

4. LLM-based Evaluation:

    a. Generates feedback.

    b. Assigns section-wise marks.

5. Presentation Evaluation: Generates feedback on handwriting quality and layout.

6. PDF Report Generation: Outputs a downloadable PDF report using reportlab.
